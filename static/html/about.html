        A site dedicated to the growth and promotion of diversity in Columbus’s
        business community.<br/>
        <br/>
        This app serves to help you discover and explore the minority owned businesses in<br/>
        Columbus. Search for restaurants, coffee shops, florists, clothing stores and much more.<br/>
        <br/>
        Columbus is a melting pot of people. We have people with backgrounds from all over the <br/>
        United States and World sharing their goods, ideas and services; molding Columbus’s own <br/>
        unique flavor of American.<br/>
        <br/>
        This app is a tool for the community; know a minority owned business you don’t see? Let us<br/>
        know. Want to leave us a comment or another suggestion, reach out and educate us. And if <br/>
        you are business owner who wants to be a part of our app, reach out to us. Click the Log In<br/>
        and send us your basic info and registration as a minority business and we will give you<br/>
        access to your own page.<br/>
        <br/>
        Right now this app is just a seed. We want it to grow with community input and participation <br/>
        as we try to build a Columbus that is conscious and open to all its residents’ have to offer.<br/>
