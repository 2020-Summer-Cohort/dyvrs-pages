        A site dedicated to the growth and promotion of diversity in Columbus’s
        business community. This app serves to help you discover and explore the minority owned businesses in
        Columbus. Search for restaurants, coffee shops, florists, clothing stores and much more. Columbus is a melting pot of people. We have people with backgrounds from all over the
        United States and World sharing their goods, ideas and services; molding Columbus’s own
        unique flavor of American.

        This app is a tool for the community; know a minority owned business you don’t see? Let us
        know. Want to leave us a comment or another suggestion, reach out and educate us. And if 
        you are business owner who wants to be a part of our app, reach out to us. Click the Log In
        and send us your basic info and registration as a minority business and we will give you
        access to your own page. Right now this app is just a seed. We want it to grow with community input and participation 
        as we try to build a Columbus that is conscious and open to all its residents’ have to offer.
